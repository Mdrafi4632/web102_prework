## Notes

1. Aligning and Styling Elements:
   * Center-aligning elements like the header, introduction, and "Our Games" section required adjustments in both HTML structure and CSS styling. Managing consistent spacing and alignment across various sections was challenging.

2. Adding New Features:
   * Implementing optional features like the search bar and scroll-to-top button required integrating JavaScript functionality seamlessly into the existing codebase. Debugging issues with event listeners and ensuring smooth scrolling behavior took extra time.

3. Dynamic Filtering and Display:
   * Filtering the games dynamically (e.g., unfunded, funded, and all) and ensuring the correct games were displayed required careful use of the filter method and interaction with DOM manipulation functions.

4. Understanding and Using Reduce:
   * Using reduce to calculate total contributions and amounts raised was initially complex, especially ensuring proper formatting of numbers with commas using toLocaleString().

5. Balancing Functionality and Visual Appeal:
   * Adding new features while maintaining an appealing and responsive design posed challenges. For instance, customizing hover effects and ensuring font and button consistency took iterative improvements.

6. Managing Spacing and Gaps:
   * Adjusting spacing between elements (e.g., paragraphs in the introduction section) required experimenting with CSS properties like margin and padding.
